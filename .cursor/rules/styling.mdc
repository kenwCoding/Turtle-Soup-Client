## Styling Priority

1. **Design System Components** - Always use our design system components first when available
2. **Tailwind Classes** - Use Tailwind utility classes when design system components don't cover your needs
3. **Custom CSS Classes** - Create reusable CSS classes in appropriate stylesheets when Tailwind doesn't provide what you need
4. **Inline Styles** - Use only as a last resort for truly one-off styling needs that can't be addressed by the above options

## Best Practices

- Avoid inline styles (`style={{}}`) whenever possible
- Compose Tailwind classes to create consistent UI patterns
- Extract commonly used Tailwind class combinations into component props or custom components
- When extending design system components, use their built-in props for customization before adding Tailwind classes
- Document any custom styling patterns that might be reused elsewhere
